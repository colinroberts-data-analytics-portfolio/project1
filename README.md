project1 coffee study 
There are four different Jupyter notebooks with code, with all the ouput in the 'Output_data' folder              
All data sets used are in the folder marked 'data'                                 
The analysis of coffee's relationship with weather is in the jupyter notebook called 'Weathercoffee-Paul A code.ipynb'

Slide 4 Question: Does weather, especially rainfall, affect the amount or quality of coffee produced?![image]
- Comments on the avg rainfall vs avg production analysis : In comparing avg rainfall to avg production amounts, we have a null hypothesis that says the amount of rainfall doesn't matter when it comes to amount of coffee produced. The p value is 0.148, so we cannot reject this null hypothesis. Again, the massive production of Brazil with a rainfall amount that falls in the middle of these regions might distort the data. It appears, though, that rainfall amounts do not necessarily affect this metric.

Slide 8 Answer to question Answer to question: What countries produce the most coffee and does that affect the quality of coffee produced?

Comments on Avg Annual Rainfall vs quality of coffee : Here, the null hypothesis is that coffee quality and avg rainfall among the coffee producing countries have nothing to do with one another. The p value turns out to be about 0.15, so we cannot reject this null hypothesis. Most coffee producing regions do get significant rainfall, but the variance within this group of coffee producing nations does not appear to significantly affect the quality of coffee produced.

Slide 16 bar chart of flavor of coffee ranking plus question 
Description of Question: 
What countries produce the most coffee and does that affect the quality of coffee produced?
- After collaborating with Mitch and Paul on the Max Production data  frames we merged a data frame that contained multiple columns for the score ranking different coffee from different countries.  They were all calculated out (1 of 10) with a float type value. Score consists of Aroma plus flavor minus aftertaste plus body plus average balance plus uniformity plus clean cup plus sweetness minus acidity minus quakers.

Slide 17 Flavor Rating by Country.png
-	this map displays that countries like Brazil have a much larger production rate than other countries like Haiti, Panama or Malawi. It is not even close. 

Slide 18 Map of Amount Produced by Country.png
-	This map displays that countries like Brazil have a much larger production rate than other countries like Haiti, Panama or Malawi. It is not even close. 


Slide 19 Scatter Plot Amount Produced by Country.png
-	this plot exhibits Max Production in a different light than previous in such that we drill down to see who is second and third and exactly how far Brazil is from the rest of the Countries, Indonesia and Columbia following but leading the rest. 

Slide 20 Bar Chart of Quality Score with trend line of Amount Produced.png
-	This bar chart with a trend line demonstrates the answer to the question. Brazil Columbia and Indonesia top three producers with Malawi, Haiti, and Panama bottom three. That said the bars behind the trendline show that there really is no difference between Countries when it comes to Score for Quality.

Slide 21 Answer to question
Answer to question: 
What countries produce the most coffee and does that affect the quality of coffee produced?
- No, it does not. What countries produce the most coffee and does NOT impact the quality of coffee produced. All of the scores are so closely related it does not appear to influence the quality even where there is a lot more of production of coffee like Brazil, they are still neck and neck with Panama, Haiti, Malawi who have barely any production of coffee in comparison.

Section : What countries consume the most coffee? Does the amount of coffee produced influence consumption?

Slide 19 Description of Question: plus Scatterplot
-	Description of Question: 
What countries consume the most coffee? Does the amount of coffee produced influence consumption?

Slide 20 bar chart of consumption
-	Broken down to top ten. This demonstrates that Brazil is still consuming as much as they are producing with Indonesia and Columbia in the top 5 as well.

Slide 21 Answer to question
Answer to question: 
What countries produce the most coffee and does that affect the quality of coffee produced?
- findings prove that production and consumption go hand in hand. Brazil producing the most coffee and in turn consuming the most coffee. Score slightly varies Country to Country but not enough to prove impact consumption. Score being quality that no matter where it is grown there is no direct link to quality from region to region or how much was produced the scores remained close. Perhaps each country has a taste for their homegrown export, perhaps the more economically convenient, Country to Country.

Slide 23 - bar chart for consumption

Slide 24 - answer to question-
The findings prove that production and consumption go hand in hand. Brazil producing the most coffee and in turn consuming the most coffee. Country for Country the data demonstrated that the more a country produced the more it consumed. Primary examples include Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Columbia.

Slide 25 Conclusion--
Moderate rainfall is required for adequate coffee production. The top producing countries also exist in a subtropical or tropical climate where warmth and rain are both plentiful.
Quantity of Production rises as temperatures rise, even within the subset of these high producing countries, but higher temperatures can adversely affect the quality of coffee beans
The optimal temperature appears to be around 65 degrees Fahrenheit/18 Celsius. Below that temperature production tends to trend down. Above that point quantity continues to rise, but we start to see less quality.
We did observe that production and consumption tended to go hand in hand. Brazil, for example, produces by far the most coffee, and they also consume the most. Country for country the data demonstrated that the more a country produces the more it consumes. In addition to Brazil,  Indonesia, Mexico and Columbia provide proof of this. 
The amount of coffee produced does not seem to affect its quality. The data from Brazil, again, shows the way here. They produce great quantities of high quality coffee.
